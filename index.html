    <p id="web-security-question">How would you advise a potential client to secure his/her website from web security attacks? Note: the word count for your answer should not be greater than 250 words</p>
    <p id="web-security-answer">To prevent web security attacks and secure a clients' website, i would advise them implementing practices such as secure authorization and authentication to ensure that authorization and authentication are hard to track. A sanitization of data to ensure that data is in correct format, implementing continuous deployment/integration (CI/DC) to catch errors and maintain reliability, network security, and automatic user timeout. Lastly, a trusted and tested third-party application.</p>
